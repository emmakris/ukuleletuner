# Ukuleletuner 
Ukulele Tuner for micro:bit

## In order to create this project you will need:
1) A micro:bit board
2) Mi: Sound Speaker board for BBC micro:bit

> A fun project which helps me tune my ukulele by hearing the tones for each string.

### Standard Ukulele Tuning is High G, C, E, A

After you upload the code to your micro:bit, by pressing "Button A" you will start hearing the tone of G string
and by clicking again the "Button A" your are continue on hearing the tone for the next string (G,C,E,A).
Pressing "Button B" you will hear the tones of the strings backwards (E,A,C,G).

For getting to the initial state press "Button A+Button B".

Have fun and keep on struming!!
